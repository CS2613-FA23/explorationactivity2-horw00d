# ExplorationActivity2
## 1. Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?

This exploration activity demonstrates the functionality of the Tone.js Web Audio framework [1] using programs written in JavaScript and HTML.

## 2. How does someone run your program?

In order to run this program, you should make sure the EA2.js and index.html files are both in the same directory. Next, navigate to that same directory in the terminal and use the node package manager to install Tone.js using the following command [1]:

 - npm install tone

After the installation is complete, open the index.html file with any browser of your choice (e.g. Chrome or Firefox). This should open up a webpage titled "Musical Synth Simulator using Tone.js". Following the definitions under the title, you can interact and test the program by clicking the buttons on the screen.

## 3. What purpose does your program serve?

The purpose of this program is to explore the pitch of musical notes and also how a group of musical notes with certain intervals can create a chord. The program features an interactive piano which includes all of the notes in an octave and allows the user to play creative melodies with a variety of sythesizer tones. The other component of the program is a random chord generator which takes individual music notes and constructs a chord. They can be played either as a full chord or as an arpeggio which plays the individual notes that construct a chord. 

## 4. What would be some sample input/output?

a) Click the "Randomize" button:
 - *Randomly selects a chord for the program to interact with and prints the notes that make up that chord*

b) Click the "Chord" button:
 - *Plays the entire current chord on each press*

c) Click the "Arpeggio" button:
 - *Plays every individual note that comprises the current cord in a sequence on each press*

d) Click the "Randomize" button again:
 - *Randomly select another chord from the library of chord options for the "Chord" and "Arpeggio" buttons to interact with*

e) Click the piano key buttons:
 - *Each key represents the note written on the face of the button and when pressed will replecate the note's pitch with a synthesizer*

f) Click the "Change Synth" button:
 - *Randomly changes the type of synthesizer tone that plays the notes generated by pressing keys on the piano, so the sound of the notes produced by the piano is now different.*
